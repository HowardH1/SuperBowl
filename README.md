SuperBowl is an bowling game with extreme courses for a challenging family experience.
# Network Game Development
Known intrusive bugs:
- When playing multiplayer, sometimes the clients camera will glitch on to their ball when inactive. Hitting the "E" Key once or twice should fix this issue
- Text overlap between the first message sent between each player
- Player still has control while using text chat, usage may result in unintended commands.
- Points will register incorrectly and thus display incorrectly in the scoreboard.
- Power Slider does not work in this version, and is merely blocking for the UI. Errors related to this are harmless and can be ignored.

How to Play:
- A, D: Shift Ball left and right at spawn
- Hold Right Mouse: Turn Camera
- Space: Bowl
- E: In singleplayer, resets ball to spawn. In Multiplayer, ends your turn and begins the next players (Host only)
- U, I: Open/Close scoreboard
